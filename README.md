Stock price prediction using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model leverages deep learning techniques to analyze historical stock data and identify patterns over time.
LSTM networks are particularly effective for time series forecasting due to their ability to remember long-term dependencies and capture complex temporal relationships. 
By training on past stock prices, trading volumes, and other relevant financial indicators, the model can generate predictions for future stock movements, aiding investors in making informed decisions. 
This approach combines advanced analytics with machine learning to enhance the accuracy of stock market forecasts.
